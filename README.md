FizzBuzz
========
You are to write a program that must fulfill these simple requirements:

For the numbers from 1 to 100,

If the number is a multiple of 3, print fizz instead of the number.
If the number is a multiple of 5, print buzz instead of the number.
If the number is a multiple of 15, print fizzbuzz instead of the number.
Otherwise, print the number itself.
Each output should be followed by a new line.
